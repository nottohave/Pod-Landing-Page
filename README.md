## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learnt

_ I learnt to practice writing semantic HTML, constructe my HTML file before styling, CSS: I learnt to import font, use position relative and absolute to position object on the webpage, declare variables for color so I do not have to repeat myself much.

I also learnt a little bit about mix-blend-mode with background image to blend the color in like the design. I use this without relying on opacity because opacity will blur the context. 

Previous update:

Update 12/19/21
README file is ready. The project is ready to be submitted to the solution page.

Update 12/9/21
Desktop view is available on responsive screen 1400 x 900 and larger.
If you enter the wrong email, it won't show anything. So I will be working on that.

Update 12/8/21
I change my approach on mobile and tablet view. I use position absolute instead of relying on padding. 
Tablet view availabel at 768 x 1024 resolution

Update 12/5/21
Mobile view is available under 375 x 777 screen size

<12/5/21 
html and css files are pushed.
